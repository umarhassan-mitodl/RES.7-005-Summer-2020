*How the teaching skills that we put into practice as TAs can make us better scientific researchers*

## Intended Learning Outcomes

1. Identify transferable skills learned in teaching
2. Illustrate the value of these skills by describing action and impact

## Facilitation Notes

Discuss as a group what transferable skills TAs might have (abilities that transfer from one job to another). Present folks with a summary, and fill in any skills they may not have yet identified.

Allow TAs to brainstorm ideas related to the common interview prompts provided that demonstrate these transferable skills (5 min). Prompt TAs to describe the moment as clearly as they can. TAs will then share one of these ideas with a partner as part of a story telling exercise (10 min). Each partner will have the opportunity to speak, and the other will act as an “interviewer”. The point of this exercise is for the speaker to get practice telling their story and for the interviewer to reflect back to them what skills or strengths are highlighted. Close out this activity by asking partners to share what skills or themes they identified.

Introduce TAs to the STAR framework for story-telling (also known as CAR – context, action, result). Provide an example that is relevant to their experience (one possible example is provided). Invite TAs to reframe their own stories using the STAR method (5 min).

If there is time, it can also be useful to have TAs practice turning a STAR story into a resumé bullet that demonstrates action and impact. Provide an example resumé bullet and have folks identify action and impact in each example for practice.

Close with an Exit Ticket that prompts folks to think about what they are taking away and what they still have questions about.
