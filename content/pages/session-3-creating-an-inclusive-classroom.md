*Implementing reflective teaching practices to foster inclusivity*

## Intended Learning Outcomes

1. Identify how different teaching practices can be received by diverse audiences.
2. Assess strategies that promote inclusivity by engaging in self-reflection.

## Facilitation Notes

Begin with a brainstorm of what it means to promote inclusivity in the classroom. Prompt TAs to come up with concrete examples of what it might look like. You can do this in a free form discussion setting, or use an anonymous polling platform.

Introduce the concept of equity vs. equality and what it means in the education setting. A set of graphics from the Center for Urban Education is included to help guide this introduction.

The primary activity for the day prompts TAs to reflect on the inclusivity of common teaching practices. In particular, they will look at ways that teachers solicit student participation in the classroom. Begin by explaining and modeling the process of guided reflection using the question prompts provided. A good example to use in modelling is the practice of cold-calling. Next, send folks into groups of 2-3 to discuss one teaching practice of their choosing. Suggest to TAs that they choose the most relevant or challenging scenario for folks in their group. Provide ~10 minutes for discussion using the guided reflection prompts. Ask one representative from each group to share out a short summary of what they discussed. A shared Google doc can also be a great way for each group to record what they are thinking. (\*Note: You may find that not all teaching practices are covered in your discussion. You may want to poll the group to see if there are any other practices which folks would want to discuss that weren’t yet touched upon.)

Close by presenting the idea that inclusive teaching is an iterative process. Teachers try a new way of soliciting participation or engaging with their students, evaluate the results, and revise as needed. (Similar to the process of scientific experimentation and revision.) A supplementary table is also provided that provides a short compilation of common strategies for inclusive participation, drawn from Tanner (2013) [Structure Matters: Twenty-one Teaching Strategies to Promote Student Engagement and Cultivate Classroom Equity.](https://www.lifescied.org/doi/full/10.1187/cbe.13-06-0115) *CBE – Life Sciences Education 12(1-10).*

Provide an Exit Ticket that prompts folks to think about what they are taking away and what they still have questions about.
