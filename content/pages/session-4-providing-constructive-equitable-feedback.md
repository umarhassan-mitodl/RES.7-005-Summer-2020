*Investigating tools and techniques for grading*

## Intended Learning Outcomes

1. Describe the features of feedback that is both effective and equitable
2. Use grading tools for effective and equitable grading

## Facilitation Notes

Begin with a discussion that asks folks to weigh in on the following question – “What is the point of giving students feedback?”. You can do this in a free form discussion setting, or use an anonymous polling platform. It can help to prompt folks to think back about a time when they received helpful feedback as a student or trainee.

Introduce TAs to the idea of effective and equitable feedback. Some salient points of discussion are provided on the slides.

The two key practices for covered in this workshop are 1) using rubrics for every assignment and 2) giving detailed feedback. Highlight the key feature of each and ask folks to brainstorm the reason why each might contribute to effective, equitable feedback. Provide a guided example of how TAs can use a rubric and give feedback (a generalized experimental example is provided). After walking through the example, ask folks what they liked and what was challenging about the process of giving feedback in that example. Discuss potential remedies to these challenges.

Next, give folks a chance to independently create their own rubric and write their own feedback using a real question and student response from a class in your department. Allow TAs to share ideas with neighbors or as a group.

Close with a discussion of some tips for grading more efficiently and preventing grading fatigue. Provide an Exit Ticket that prompts folks to think about what they are taking away and what they still have questions about.
